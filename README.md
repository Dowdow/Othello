# Othello

Game developped with Java to test different levels and algorythms of artificial in intelligence.

There is multiple levels of artificial intelligence that can play together in simulated games :

- IA Facile : Choose a random square
- IA Moyenne : Choose the move that bring the maximum points
- IA Difficile : Same as IA Moyenne but with support for sides and angles (that are importanter in the game)
- IA Expert : Same as IA Difficile with min max algorythm

Humans can also play :)
